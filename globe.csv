2425684,there are no easy answers but surely the ideal approach is not to routinely remove children from their homes and ship them far away dislocated from community and family where the cycle of hopelessness begins anew . taking vulnerable children and putting them in a more vulnerable position is as ms turpellafond says pointedly an approach that grooms young people and girls in particular for victimization and re-victimization as they too often spiral down into the clutches of addiction sex work human trafficking and sometimes become yet another of the invisible women on the tragically long list of missing and murdered . today the reports to the authorities may be a little more pointed but the action is still lacking

2408706,consultation needed to fight exploitation . indigenous affairs minister says any effort to combat human trafficking must include input from survivors women shelters . a broad approach by the federal government is needed to tackle the issue of human trafficking in canada one that recognizes the domestic nature of the crime and is formulated with input from grassroots organizations and survivors the indigenous affairs minister says . in an interview with the globe and mail carolyn bennett said the issue requires extensive involvement from at least five federal departments justice health public safety and status of women along with her ... her comments come after a globe story showed most recorded human-trafficking cases in canada are for the purpose of sexual exploitation and the majority 94 per cent take place within this country borders . the three-month investigation explored how indigenous women and girls are disproportionately affected as victims of trafficking and the root causes of why they are at higher risk . dr bennett said she was very grateful for the globe story because all those elements are pieces that we are hearing coast to coast to coast in consultations about the mandate and scope of a pending inquiry into canada more than 1 200 missing and murdered indigenous women ... their stories of it was almost me it could have been me are really important as we shed some light on this the globe story also showed an uneven response from the federal government . in 2012 the conservative government unveiled a four-year 25 dollar-million action plan to prevent human trafficking prosecute perpetrators and aid victims . since then more than 90 per cent of what has been spent appears to have gone to law enforcement and to addressing international trafficking ... canada has faced international criticism for its response to the issue . the us state department noted last year that women from aboriginal communities are especially vulnerable to sex trafficking and called federal funding of special services for victims inadequate the united nations said last year that insufficient efforts have been made to address the vulnerability of aboriginal women and girls to trafficking . the new government says its approach differs from the previous one in which former prime minister stephen harper said the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women was not a sociological phenomenon but rather a criminal one best handled by police ... the government is committed to working with provinces and territories indigenous communities law enforcement and community organizations to combat exploitation and to support victims and potential victims it said . status of women minister patricia hajdu said in an e-mail that her department will keep focusing on prevention efforts and working with communities to strengthen our response to human trafficking so that some of society most vulnerable members will be better protected
2408726,we need more than laws to end the exploitation . lecturer at the peter a allard school of law at ubc human trafficking as a legal concept aims to identify situations of exploitation that arise through the use of force coercion or deception . but what is actually meant when someone invokes the phrase human trafficking . what kinds of exploitation does it ... how should it best be addressed . on the international stage human trafficking is often associated with cross-border movement . it is also often connected to the sex trade . in canada human trafficking has become inextricably entwined with wider debates on the sex trade . significant attention has been paid to the issue of domestic sex trafficking the sexual exploitation of canadian women and girls and in particular of indigenous women and girls . the synonymy of human trafficking and sexual exploitation is powerful as is the sensationalism it produces . although the human-trafficking label may be valued as a way to galvanize public attention it comes with significant challenges in concretely responding to the issues it seeks to address . like many countries canada has primarily responded to the issue of human trafficking through criminal-justice measures . this is problematic for several ... this approach also neglects the voices of the individuals it seeks to protect . the way in which human trafficking is invoked often reduces its subject or victim to an object xlike status she is too helpless to speak for herself . she must be spoken for ... this perception can do significant harm to the affected individual robbing her of dignity and a voice . the resulting narrow focus of the criminal-justice approach to human trafficking effectively minimizes space for critical discourse about its value and effectiveness as a legal or policy framework . the focus on criminal-justice measures also minimizes space for considering more pro-active or preventative measures that might reduce the occurrence of exploitative situations . discussions about human trafficking often signal the need to address the root causes that enable exploitation . yet the reality of the underlying issues that create vulnerability to exploitation is far more complex than the criminal-justice approach ... in canada anti-trafficking discourse similarly signals the need to bring greater attention to addressing root causes . a message that is heightened when conversations about domestic sex trafficking intersect with the issue of exploitation of indigenous women and girls . indigenous women and girls are often reported as disproportionately represented in the sex trade ... it is the result of systemic neglect and harm and addressing these systemic issues should be the primary aim of response measures . focusing greater attention on the underlying issues facing indigenous women and on what meaningful alternatives look like would go much further than the current criminal-justice approach to human trafficking is capable of . listening to the voices of indigenous women is perhaps the most important step in this direction ... how that discussion is framed and whose voices are heard will significantly impact the outcomes of the inquiry . current approaches to addressing human trafficking create little space to hear the voices of those most affected . yet hearing the voices of persons affected might be the most important factor in making progress on this issue

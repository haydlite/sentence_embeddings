14004319,front sex slaves win cash in landmark legal deal four given ps 140 000 compensation thousands could get state help top british terror suspect escapes . sex slaves smuggled into britain are set to receive millions of ps for their pain and trauma after a groundbreaking government decision to compensate victims of people trafficking . the first payouts of more than ps 140 000 were made last week to four women who suffered a sustained period of sexual abuse ... authority officials told the london law firm lovells which is acting for a number of the victims that it would officially recognise the trauma experienced by thousands of women and children . the development is likely to be politically controversial with charges that offering help to trafficking victims could encourage illegal immigration . the women who received ps 140 000 were smuggled from eastern europe by british-based criminals using established international sex trafficking networks . one girl was illegally brought into the uk five years ago aged ... the authority which awards compensation to victims of violent crime has agreed payments for false imprisonment and forced prostitution during the time of their imprisonment though neither exists as an official category for damages . sarah johnson of lovells said this will serve as a precedent for other cases and we are delighted the poppy project which helps trafficked women after they have been rescued from their captors hailed the payments as a tremendous breakthrough and said that in theory at least thousands of women would qualify . the women who have received compensation are understood not to have been deported ... alongside the controversy of granting women the right to remain even if only for a limited period there are also concerns that traffickers might force women to make fraudulent compensation claims that would find their way to criminals . although trafficking victims will only be required to make a police report as opposed to assisting a full criminal investigation to register a claim experts said the fact they would require legal help as well as having to prove they had successfully escaped their traffickers would help prevent suspect claims . julie barton of the poppy project said previously women have received no financial support for them to start afresh or to address the terrible circumstances they have had to endure ... often they are forced to return vulnerable and traumatised to their home country without any support . the scale of sex trafficking is of increasing concern to police . officially the home office believes the number of illegal immigrants being sexually exploited at any one time is about 4 000 ... the problem of trafficking is far greater than officially recognised and can no longer be considered a big city problem said johnson of lovells . in most cases trafficked women enter the uk overtly using forged visas false travel documents or visas obtained through corruption or deception usually from their traffickers . barton confirmed her group was aware of a growing number of women who were being prosecuted carrying false documents given to them by organised criminals

18006509,her accounts provide a rare glimpse of the scale of off-street prostitution in britain which is notoriously problematic to quantify . charities say marinela experience supports their belief that sex trafficking into the uk is significantly greater than officially recognised . an investigation by senior police officers last year identified almost 5 890 brothels saunas massage parlours and venues used illegally for paid sex in england and wales ... women groups also lament the lack of police action against venues known to be selling sex illegally . despite identifying huge numbers of brothels and sex trafficked victims there is little evidence of a concerted police crackdown to close premises . when david greenwood 43 was jailed last year for running the belle air and shangri-la as brothels the court heard that both had been known to police for ... the chief commissioner florea stefan said marinela is lucky to be alive many girls are beaten very very badly he said nejloveanu exported five girls to the uk but another seven had vanished in romania . trafficked girls are sometimes killed by their pimps . everyone knows that said marinela ... some are forced some want to work but many many go to spain . it is a big problem when marinela arrived at the police station stefan was interviewing a trafficking victim from spain . nejloveanu father bogdan was extradited from spain to face trial in manchester ... her mother managed a faint smile before wiping away another tear . the most comprehensive inquiry into sex trafficking and off-street prostitution in the uk identified 17 000 migrants working in brothels . of these about half 9 000 were from eastern europe of which police believe 400 had been trafficked ... the police investigation detected another 5 000 women from eastern europe working in brothels who were willing to work as prostitutes and could not be considered trafficked or vulnerable . campaigners however say the police definition of vulnerable included many victims of trafficking and that their inquiry significantly underestimates the problem . the poppy project argues that many women find it difficult to disclose issues such as rape and that the police methodology which involved officers entering brothels and asking women if they had been trafficked was unlikely to glean accurate information

18018189,this saturday marks the 224th anniversary of the inaugural meeting of the anti-slavery movement in london the city where abina was enslaved most of last year . now timothy brain the uk most senior police officer dealing with human trafficking before his recent retirement has decided to speak out about his mounting frustration over government policy on the issue as well as the abhorrent nature of the crime . we think back to the cotton plantations and sugar plantations of the 18th and 19th century and it would not be as bad as what some victims go through ... the government has vowed repeatedly to take the issue seriously . last monday immigration minister damian green told parliament it is simply intolerable that in 2011 human trafficking still plagues this country yet concern is mounting that the systems put in place to help victims and target traffickers are being systematically dismantled by the coalition . abina escaped last october ... abina was arrested as an illegal immigrant and sent to yarl wood detention centre for deportation . four weeks later the poppy project charity assessed her identified her as a trafficking victim prevented her deportation and is now helping abina rebuild her life . gloria also made a break for it one afternoon ... although police arrested her captors the case was dropped for insufficient evidence . locating trafficking victims is notoriously difficult . most cases emerge through a network of voluntary groups or occasional police raids on known brothels ... but now brain the architect of those police operations believes that momentum is being lost . pentameter perceived success led to the formation of the uk human trafficking centre a pioneering facility that pulled together intelligence police and immigration experts . the centre closed in sheffield in april 2010 moving to the serious organised crime agency soca and since then sources say that 90 percent of its specialist staff have left ... brain believes the relegation of the trafficking centre to an undefined role within a new organisation betrays a shifting of priorities the net result is that it is just going lower and lower down someone else policy agenda said the former chief constable . with the resignation of the human trafficking centre head former detective chief superintendent nick kinsella anti-trafficking policing has lost a recognisable national co-ordinator . when soca was asked last week who now headed its anti-trafficking team its press office could not recall the incumbent surname ... concern is mounting that an apparent lack of proactive policing has bolstered britain reputation as a soft touch for traffickers who can operate without fear of being caught and prosecuted . whitehall sources cite a lack of frontline police officers trained to identify trafficked people especially women who are often too terrified to approach police and testify against their captors . kinsella ambition was for every frontline police officer to understand the impact trafficking had on its victims and to treat such women as victims rather than illegal immigrants but he believes that this is not happening ... abina traffickers were never arrested because of difficulties trying to identify the correct address . on average there have been 25 convictions a year for sex trafficking since 2004 with only eight in england last year . scotland and wales have yet to record a single successful prosecution ... senior legal sources say that is too easy for accused traffickers to plead guilty to lesser charges . the attorney general dominic grieve will shortly meet the all-party parliamentary group for human trafficking to discuss possible changes to the law . peter bone the group tory chair said someone in the cps told me that if they were in government they had tear it up and start again regardless of the technical difficulties the consensus among the voluntary sector is that trafficking political profile has slipped ... brain said that trafficking underground nature helped explain its position as peripheral to what most home office and police strategists see as core business . anthony steen chair of the human trafficking foundation said in william wilberforce day slavery could be seen . now it is hidden from view but no less prevalent another factor influencing the allocation of resources to combat trafficking is quantifying the numbers ... charities still fear a ministerial document with no specific targets or concrete promises . britain purports to be a world leader in fighting human trafficking . now they say is the time to prove it . police intelligence collated for operation acumen the most authoritative effort to determine the scale of sex trafficking in england and wales identified 2 600 migrant women who had been trafficked and a further 9 200 vulnerable women who might include trafficking victims . some senior figures including former chief constable timothy brain believe the combined total of 11 800 constitutes an accurate estimate of trafficked women . 17 000 migrant sex workers were identified during the police ... the region with the second highest number of brothels and sex shops 534 was yorkshire and humber with each establishment having an average of 4dot4 beds . the metropolitan police estimate that trafficked women forced into prostitution see between 20 and 30 men a day which would mean at least 7 300 contacts if forced to work every day of the year . captions finding victims of trafficking is fraught with difficulty . photograph by

left croydon gilroy court hotel and then she disappeared ... there she met the man who would change her life . from the documents it is evident the character referred to only as steve is a human trafficker . he promised joy a new life in europe ... in the month joy went missing there were 491 unaccompanied children seeking asylum in croydon and it is these say police who are most vulnerable to traffickers . no one knows how many vanish without trace into the sex trade but local campaigners estimate that up to two trafficking victims can be found for each of the borough 40 or so brothels . in london a further 2 103 illegal massage parlours and sex shops have been identified by police intelligence ... if she told the truth to the investigators joy appears to have been treated relatively well compared to others trapped in britain frequently violent sex trade . scotland yard estimates that trafficked victims on average are forced to sleep with seven clients a day . in addition joy was allowed to use condoms keep a portion of her earnings and never admitted to being beaten or tortured ... too many investigations he believes are wound down before they even get started . one issue is that police forces have no clear-up targets for locating missing trafficked children . normally there are no family and friends campaigning for information ... even with a committed police team actively seeking leads joy case demonstrates the challenges of finding a child who might be held by criminals . both the uk human trafficking centre and scd9 scotland yard anti-trafficking unit are aware of the nigerian disappearance but intriguingly no mention is made of the involvement of the child exploitation and online protection centre on 1 july ceop was handed responsibility for leading attempts to find missing children promising rapid and effective conclusions to complex or high-profile cases but only one specific appeal for a missing child currently appears on the agency website that of madeleine mccann . instead the official missing kids website says the search for joy is being led by the national police improvement agency a body about to be axed by the government . it is this casual approach says elvin that demonstrates how foreign child-trafficking victims receive a second-rate service compared to british cases . scotland yard media bureau which frequently circulates appeals for missing people has yet to issue a request for information regarding joy seven months after her ... a former head of ceop he led the national criminal intelligence service fight against child sex abuse and before that northern ireland anti-terrorist intelligence unit in belfast . he agrees that attempts to locate foreign child-trafficking victims are cursory at best . the true extent of the government commitment at the minute is simply making sure a picture goes up that no one ever sees ... one boy had his face pressed down on a hob to ensure he never called the police once they are gone few resurface . child protection experts say that placing trafficked children like joy or vananh in the same locale as their captors exacerbates the risk

trafficked children disappearing . many go missing it warned within 24 hours of arriving in ... it took six weeks after she went missing before a report appeared in the local paper coincidentally the day before joy vanished . the national referral mechanism nrm introduced in 2009 to protect trafficked victims by rapidly identifying possible cases to the uk border agency was supposed to change a system which a growing number of child-protection specialists believes discriminates against foreign children in favour of british youngsters . joy was referred to the nrm but prompt protection was neither apparent or forthcoming ... among the guests will be immigration minister damian green who unveiling the government anti-trafficking strategy six days after joy 18th birthday promised to ensure that children remain a focus of our efforts as we look to combat these traffickers who exploit vulnerable children . during the three months since the minister statement there has not been a single uk conviction for child trafficking . the organised criminals traffickers and brothel owners in the case of joy vananh or lena are also likely to evade prosecution ... now 18 joy is finally

22077834,charged up to ps25 000 for their passage to the uk these children collectively owe their traffickers almost ps75m . while there is growing awareness of the use of trafficked vietnamese people in the booming domestic cannabis trade child trafficking experts are now warning that the british authorities are unable to keep up with the speed at which uk-based vietnamese gangs are recruiting and exploiting children for use in other criminal enterprises such as gun-smuggling crystal meth production and prostitution rings . by our calculations there are around 3 000 vietnamese children in the uk who are being used for profit by criminal gangs says philip ishola former head of the uk counter human trafficking bureau . the police and the authorities are now aware that trafficked children are being forced to work in cannabis farms but this is really only the tip of the iceberg . often the same child will be exploited not just in a cannabis farm but also in myriad different ... this is happening right under our noses and not enough is being done to stop it police admit that they are struggling with the speed at which vietnamese criminal gangs are diversifying and expanding their activities across the england and into scotland and northern ireland . right now we are just fighting in the trenches fighting in the nail bars said detective inspector steven cartwright who heads police scotland human trafficking unit . it is vital that we that we understand new methods being deployed by the gangs because we need to stop demand at one end or limit their ability to make money at the other hien journey to the uk started when he was taken from his village at the age of five by someone who claimed to be his uncle ... he told his story to the police but was still sent to young offenders institution in scotland where he spent 10 months on remand charged with cannabis cultivation . he was released only after the intervention of a crown prosecutor led to him being identified as a victim of trafficking . vietnamese children such as hien are easy pickings for the increasingly sophisticated trafficking gangs operating between the uk and vietnam . children make up nearly a quarter of the estimated 13 000 people trafficked into the uk every year and vietnamese children are the largest group of children trafficked to the uk . the united nations office on drugs and crime estimates that 30 vietnamese children arrive illegally in the uk every month on well-established smuggling ... upon arrival the children are faced with a highly organised system of criminal activity with methods of control ranging from extreme physical brutality to debt bondage . before they even arrive that trap is set for them members of the vietnamese diaspora in london told the observer that they had seen an explosion in child trafficking by criminal gangs operating on the peripheries of their communities in recent years . some of these children and victims have told me that it cost them ps25 000 to get to the uk said one vietnamese community leader in london who did not want to be named ... that is slavery and exploitation like hien many of the children end up working on cannabis farms . the link between child trafficking and the uk domestic cannabis industry has been increasing with vietnamese children the main group at risk . according to a 2014 report by the ngo antislavery international almost all potential victims of trafficking linked to cannabis are vietnamese and more than 80 percent are children . many of these children are subsequently prosecuted by the uk justice system despite many being identified as potential victims of trafficking . this has led to vietnamese children becoming the second-largest ethnic group held in youth detention centres across the ... as their grip on the domestic cannabis trade slips a little they are looking to maximise their profits from these children in whatever way they can he adds . the metropolitan police say that there is now much more awareness of the complexity of tackling the uk child trafficking problem but that the closed nature of the vietnamese community has made things difficult . what has persistently been a challenge for us is making inroads into this community says phil brewer who heads its new human trafficking and kidnap unit . we usually only find out about a child when we make a raid and find someone in a cannabis factory or nail bar but often this person has been through multiple forms of exploitation before we reach them related up to 13 000 working as slaves in uk parosha chandran a leading human rights barrister and un expert on trafficking has represented vietnamese children charged with cannabis cultivation who have gone through many different trafficking situations before being moved into cannabis ... however chandran says that vietnamese children continue to be prosecuted for cannabis cultivation while their traffickers remain free . the modern slavery act central focus on prosecution is misguided and its provisions fail to fully protect the rights of trafficked children she says . we as a democratic country need to find durable solutions to ensure these children remain protected from harm for the rest of their lives at safe accommodation for child trafficking victims run by the charity love146 lynne chitty its uk care director says that she has helped between 40 and 50 vietnamese children try to rebuild their lives after trafficking experiences . we have seen children starting to be exploited in multiple ways to maximise the profit that can be gained from them she says . we recently had a client who was in domestic servitude forced to work in a nail bar during the day and every evening taken to a brothel and exploited there all night related human traffickers may face life sentence under britain tough new slavery bill methods used to lure children from vietnam to the uk are also becoming increasingly sophisticated including use of social media . vietnamese children are brought to the uk taken in by vietnamese adults and put to domestic work says swat pandi from the nspcc child trafficking advice centre . the child feels indebted to the adults for food and shelter and is told they need to return the favour by looking after cannabis ... it is very much business as usual she says . we still have a problem with immediate safeguarding and appropriate placements for trafficked children . and young people are still being criminalised by the courts even when a child has been taken out of trafficking and come under the care of a local authority he or she is likely to return to the control of the traffickers . in 2013 a report by independent thinktank the centre for social justice concluded that 60 percent of trafficked children in local authority care go missing nearly a third of them within a week of arrival . most are never found ... british children make up the largest group of trafficked young people while vietnamese children are the largest number of foreign nationals exploited in the uk . the national crime agency has reported a 34 percent rise in potential trafficking victims in 2014 compared with a year earlier . adults are predominantly victims of sexual exploitation while minors are exploited for labour ... the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children nspcc says that 51 percent of all the young people referred to itschild trafficking advice centre from vietnam have been reported missing at one time . anti-slavery international says that of the potential trafficking victims who were forced to cultivate cannabis 96 percent were from vietnam and 81 percent of those were children . nearly 25 percent of all trafficking victims are children . agencies report that victims are being sold on along with their debt for as much as ps30 000 to other traffickers for multiple exploitation including sex trafficking domestic servitude and cannabis cultivation

22107472,victims are involved in criminal activities warns the children charity barnardo . a new system to protect trafficked children indicates that there has been an alarming rise in the number of albanian child slaves forced to work in the uk . if the trend being highlighted on anti-slavery day were to continue albanians could soon outnumber vietnamese children as britain most exploited juvenile group . figures shared with the observer by the children charity barnardo which is trialling a new home office-funded advocacy service to provide better protection for child-trafficking victims suggest that a growing number of children from the former communist state are arriving in the uk often voluntarily only to end up being exploited . within the past year there has been an increase in the number of trafficked children from albania whom we support across our services said javed khan barnardo chief executive . he said some were used as forced labour often on building sites but most were exploited for criminal ... however the true number of exploited children is probably significantly higher khan suggested . we know the current estimate of the number of trafficked children in the uk is just the tip of the iceberg he said . due to the secretive nature of trafficking and inconsistency in collecting data across several agencies it is difficult to definitively estimate the number of trafficked children in the uk . but we do know that many frontline professionals are not aware of the signs of trafficking barnardo is running a pilot service that sees trafficked children given a special advocate to look after their interests and to protect them from falling back into the hands of organised criminal gangs when they have been referred to social services . most of those helped were aged between 15 and 17 but the barnardo schemes have encountered cases involving children as young as ... this happens even after support has been put in place due to threats by their traffickers . an independent advocate provides a single point of contact to the child allowing them to build a relationship of trust and break the link with traffickers an interim appraisal of the advocate scheme being piloted in three regions in the uk suggests that albanian children comprise a quarter of all trafficked children being helped by the new service . they are second only to vietnamese children forced to work on cannabis farms and in nail bars who make up more than 30 percent of the 160 cases overseen by barnardo so far ... the new focus on the uk suggests that traffickers could be changing their tactics . a report by the protection project in 2010 stated that in 2007 greece was reported as the main destination for trafficked victims transited from or through albania related putting slavery firmly on development agenda is just the beginning | kevin hyland the traffickers primarily use land routes and falsified documents to transfer their victims across borders . kidnapping and deception of young women and girls for commercial sexual exploitation remains the main recruiting method used by traffickers ... once transported to the destination country they are forced into prostitution and brutally abused . khan said it was a concern that the protection of trafficked children across the uk remained piecemeal . we know that trafficked children are still going missing from care across the country as they are placed in inappropriate accommodation and denied the support to which they are entitled he said . we urge the home secretary to establish legal powers for advocates so that they can compel public authorities to provide trafficked children with this

24003226,small ads sex trafficking the battle against backpage . backpage started out with small ads for household goods . so how did it grow into a major online market for child sex trafficking . annie kelly meets some of the survivors and reveals how their fight for justice became a battleground for free speech on the ... anyone could see from the pictures in the ad she was just a child yet they allowed her to be bought and sold in this public marketplace and backpage was making money off this abuse . i talked to ma and we said oh no this has to stop in 2010 kubiiki and ma sued backpage arguing that the site was facilitating child sex trafficking . what they did not know at the time was that their lawsuit would be the first spark in an epic seven-year legal assault on the website that it would pitch child trafficking victims against some of the world largest tech companies in what has been described as nothing less than the battle for the soul of the internet . to really understand what happened it is important to chart how backpage went from a feisty start-up to one of the world largest prostitution ... i certainly do not think anyone at new times intended for the website to become what it has become says mazzio . almost immediately after launching reports of child trafficking among backpage sex ads had started ringing alarm bells . at first there were clear signs of good faith they removed full-frontal nudity hired moderators ... some campaigners believe that up to 100 000 children like ma are exploited for profit across the country every year . what we do know for certain is that since 2010 the number of reports of suspected sex trafficking has gone off the chart we registered an 846 percent increase between 2010-2014 and this number is growing every year says souras . and we believe a large driver of this has been the increased use of the internet in the buying and selling of children souras says the unfettered and largely unregulated growth of the internet has been a gift for traffickers ... all the client needs is an internet connection says souras . she laughs at backpage argument that by screening ads for signs of child trafficking and reporting potential illegal activity to the authorities online classified sites carrying adult listings are key players in the fight against online trafficking . let us be clear about what these ads are about ... by their own admission backpage edited approximately 80 percent of adult ads she says . even with this being the case no one looking at the adult ads or dating section of backpage would have any doubt that many of these ads relate to potentially illegal activity or exploitative content nobody has a clear idea of how many children have been sold on backpage but currently 73 percent of child sex trafficking reports ncmec receives from the public relate to backpage ads . ncmec early collaborative relationship with backpage soured when souras said it became clear the site was using ncmec as good pr but failing to implement adequate checks and balances that the centre believed needed to be put in place to protect vulnerable children ... they just kept on winning says brad myles director of anti-trafficking group polaris . judge after judge accepted that backpage was not accountable under us law for the child trafficking occurring on its website . backpage was according to the courts no different from any other web publisher provided immunity for content posted by third parties under the 1996 communications and decency act where section 230 had been included to ensure that the burgeoning tech industry was not crushed by litigation ... it does not matter if they profited from it or even if they suspect it is illegal goldman also points out the civil cases brought against backpage by families seeking damages for the exploitation of their children are a drop in the ocean of lawsuits engulfing backpage over the past seven years . many of the state and federal litigations launched against backpage are targeting the website for all of its online sex ads not just the cases of child trafficking that occur on its site i reject this concept that it is child trafficking victims versus the tech industry says goldman . my question is that if the goal of this litigation is to benefit the victims of sex trafficking is this really the best way to do this . will destroying backpage stop other children being exploited ... and these are values worth fighting for regardless of which side you come down on it looks as if the net could be closing around backpage . when carl ferrer failed to answer a subpoena to appear before a senate subcommittee in 2016 investigating child trafficking the senate response was to launch a full-blown
